Problems in Microservices:
    1: Service instance Go Down.
    2: Service is slow.


Solution to Problem 1:
    : create multiple instance of same service and service discovery
        will take care of everything after that. If one service go
        down service discovery will redirect the requests to the
        available instance.

Solution to Problem 2:
    : use circuit breaker pattern.
